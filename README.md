Virtual Book Management System
Description and Context
This project is the development of a Book Management System using pure PHP without the use of additional frameworks. The system will allow users to register, log in, and efficiently manage their books, authors, and categories. Users will be able to create, update, and delete books, as well as manage the categories and authors associated with each book. They can also manage their personal profiles, add books to their favorite list, and log out securely.
